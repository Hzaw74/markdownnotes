# Spotlight Effect

There is something in psychology known as the “spotlight effect.” This is the phenomenon where people tend to overestimate how much others notice aspects of one’s appearance or behavior. This causes a lot of social anxiety for people, and I want to help try to dilute some of that. Most people do not care about how you look or what you’re doing. I’m not saying that in a cruel way. I’m saying that in a practical way. If most people don’t notice or don’t care, then that knowledge should help us combat social anxiety and be more comfortable being ourselves. 

So while we’re out here worrying about what others are noticing about us, in reality, most of them aren’t. This is because most people are too preoccupied thinking about themselves or something that they are doing.
