# Lucid Dream

It happens during REM sleep. 

To get Lucid Dream
- Get more REM sleep
- Have a dream diary
- Mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD): In this technique, you tell yourself repeatedly that you will dream and that you will be aware that you are dreaming. The technique relies on a form of memory known as prospective memory, or the ability to remember future events, to activate a lucid dream state.
- Practice reality testing: This process involves doing checks while awake and asleep to determine if one is dreaming. For example, you might try pressing your finger against a wall to see if you are dreaming. If you are not, the solid wall would stop your finger. In a dream, however, your finger might simply pass through the wall. Getting used to doing reality testing while awake may help make it easier to do it while you are asleep.
