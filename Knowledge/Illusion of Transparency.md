# Illusion of Transparency

The illusion of transparency is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate the degree to which their thoughts and emotions are apparent to others.

For example, the illusion of transparency can cause people who feel nervous about public speaking to overestimate the degree to which their nervousness is noticed by the audience.

## Why we experience the illusion of transparency

People experience the illusion of transparency because they have a natural egocentric[^1] bias, which causes them to rely too heavily on their own perspective when trying to consider the perspective of others.

Because you spend the vast majority of your time considering your thoughts and actions from your own perspective, it’s hard for you to adjust from the anchor of your own point of view when you attempt to imagine how others see you.
